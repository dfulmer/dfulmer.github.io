# About Me
I'm a programmer at the University of Michigan's Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library, where I develop software and integrations that support library operations.

Iâ€™ve worked extensively with legacy and modern library systems, including NOTIS, Aleph, Alma, and CORAL, with a specialization in Acquisitions workflows and bibliographic metadata.
